# Creating COCA word vectors

A tutorial (.pynb) on how to create word vectors for the *Corpus of Contemporary American English* (COCA).

About COCA:

The steps as noted in the Jupyter Notebook include importing the necessary libraries, and the necessary preprocessing steps, before generating word embeddings.

This is performed on a combined version of the text corpora, available for a given year, i.e, combining 'News', 'Academic literature', and the other COCA text sources available for a particular year, into one combined text file.

In the given tutorial, we are computing fastText vectors on the corpus for the year 1997 only, using Gensim.
