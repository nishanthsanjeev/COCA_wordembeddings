# Creating COCA word vectors
A tutorial (.pynb) on how to create word vectors for the Corpus of Contemporary American English.

About COCA - 

The steps as noted in the Jupyter Notebook include importing the necessary libraries, and the necessary preprocessing steps, before computing word embeddings.
This is performed on a combined version of the text corpora, available for a given year, i.e, combining 'News', 'Academic literature', and the other COCA text sources available for the year 1990, into one combined 1990 text file.

In the given tutorial, we are computing fastText vectors on the corpus for the year 1997 only, using gensim.
